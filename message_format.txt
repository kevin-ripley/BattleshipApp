Our implementation uses pythons built in SimpleHTTPRequestHandler class. No message header is specified directly in the code. When a GET method is called, the format of the message is standard application/x-www-form-urlencoded format. The content header is not directly specified. The POST format is the X and Y cordinates of the 'fire' message encoded using URL formatted strings for Web Forms as specified in the assignment. 

No flatbuffers or Protocol Buffers were used.
