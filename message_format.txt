Our implementation uses pythons built in SimpleHTTPRequestHandler class. No flatbuffers or Protocol Buffers were used. When a GET method is called, the format of the message is standard application/x-www-form-urlencoded format. 


The POST method has the following format:

header: 
{
'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
'Accept': 'text/plain'
}
body:
{
'x': X,
'y': Y
}

The GET method has the following format:

header:
{
'Content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
}
url:
the requested URL of the file needed. (e.g. own_board.html or opponent_board.html)
